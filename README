Thank you for downloading the Magic Carpet plugin! In order to enable it, just drop the .jar file into your plugins folder in your CraftBukkit directory.
Then, just start your server like normal and enjoy!

In order to use the magic carpet, type in the command /magiccarpet, or you can use /mc for short if you want. This will bring up a 5x5 area of glass underneath your feet
that moves with you. Just put in the command again to remove it. However, you can now specify the size of the magic carpet! In order to do so, just put in either a 3, 5,
or 7 after your /mc command. This will create either a 3x3, 5x5, or 7x7 carpet based on your input. When you put one of the sizes after the command when you already have a
carpet out, if the size is the same as the carpet you have now, the carpet is removed. If it is different, the the carpet will change sizes.

This plugin has a permissions system that is based on the contents of the file magiccarpet.properties. If you don't mind who uses the carpet, you can do nothing, and all users
are allowed ot use it. If you want to have permissions, create a text file and save it as magiccarpet.properties. Once you run the server the first time, it will set the
file up for use. In order to allow a user to use the command, just put their username after the "can-fly=" in the properties file, seperating multiple users names with commas. 
If it is easier for you to list who you do NOT want to use the command, just change the "can-fly=" in the properties file to "cannot-fly=", and put those who you do not want 
to use the command after it seperated by commas.

Alternatively, you can use the Permissions plugin. In order to specify the magic carpet plugin in the config.yml file, type 'magiccarpet.mc' like that in single quotes after
the permissions area where you are trying to apply it.

If you have any problems, don't hesitate to mention them at the bukkit forum thread for this plugin, or message my Bukkit account, Android, at the forums.
